The first three Jupyter notebook exports deal with preliminary work,  
like implementing Chebyshev basis into our exiting solution or segment size experiments.  
Notebook exports 03 - 06 cover the essential results discussed in our paper.  
Notebook export 07 documents generation of plots for the paper.
