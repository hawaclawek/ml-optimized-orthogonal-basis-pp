# Experimental results for publication "Machine Learning Optimized Orthogonal Basis Piecewise Polynomial Approximation"

The first three Jupyter notebook exports deal with preliminary work,  
like implementing Chebyshev basis into our exiting solution or segment size experiments.  
Notebook exports 03 - 06 cover the essential results discussed in our paper.  
Notebook export 07 documents generation of plots for the paper.  
  
**The code used to generate these results is available here:**
